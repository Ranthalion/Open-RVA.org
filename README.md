# [OpenRVA](http://open-rva.org/)  

Open RVA is an "unconference," also called an "Open Space" conference, which is organized on the fly by attendees, for attendees.  

Open RVA is participant-driven, with topics selected by attendees on Friday night. A schedule is built, again by anyone who wants to participate in that activity, and then on Saturday the main event happens. Open RVA is for anyone interested in technology, learning about technology, working in the tech industry, starting a tech company, or just being a part of the Richmond technology community.
